                <p>Guess the colour. <br> <br>
                    in Beginner, you will play 4 possible colours and 10 attempts. <br><br>
                    in Intermediate, you will have 5 colours to choose from and 8 attempts. <br><br>
                    in Advanced, you will have 6 colour to combine and 6 attempts. <br><br>
                    With the avaible colours you must try combinations until you find the solution. <br><br>
                    When you press the check button you will see how many colours <br><br>
                    you have found in the correct spot (marked with purple ball) <br><br>
                    and how many colours you got right, but in the wrong spot (marked with white balls). <br>
                    Good luck! </p>
